## Analysis
## City-Wise Profitability and Expiry Losses

Jamshedpur stands out as the most profitable city, showing stronger profit margins compared to other locations such as Aurangabad and Asansol. This indicates that Jamshedpur could serve as a performance benchmark for other regions.

Expiry-related financial losses are distributed across major cities, with Bangalore, Thane, Nagpur, and Hyderabad being more affected. These regions indicate a need for targeted interventions in inventory planning and supply chain accuracy.

## Category-Wise Margin Insights

Categories like Immune Care demonstrate the highest profit margins at approximately 85%, making them strategic contributors to profitability. In contrast, Digestive Care and General Wellness show relatively modest margins of around 75%, highlighting potential areas for margin optimization.

## Expiry Trend Analysis

The expiry loss trend peaks in Q2 and Q3 of 2025, followed by a noticeable decline. This reduction aligns with the implementation of improved inventory control processes, indicating a positive operational impact.

## High-Risk Inventory Categories

Hair Care (32%), Health Supplements (27%), and Oral Care (17%) fall into the high-risk inventory category. Their current stock levels are significantly lower than the average monthly demand, suggesting an urgent need for demand forecasting and supply realignment.
